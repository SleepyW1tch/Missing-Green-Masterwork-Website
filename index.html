                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p> Younger generations are exposed to vast amounts of information daily, yet they often lack the critical tools to discern truth from manipulation. Education plays a crucial role in shaping conscious consumers of online content.
                    Sustainability and climate issues are particularly vulnerable to greenwashing and deceptive narratives.</p>

            <h2>Student Feedback</h2>
            <blockquote>"During the gameplay I felt excited and really focused. It was fascinating to try to come up with creative ideas while also thinking critically about the topic. I enjoyed the competitive part and the chance to express our thoughts in a fun way. One thing I really appreciated was how the activity made me think differently and more deeply about the issues we were discussing. I was a bit sad that we didn't get to try the app. I think it would have made the gameplay even more exciting.
Overall, it was a really great game, and if I have the chance to play it again in the future, I definitely will. One of the biggest advantages of this game is that it helps improve your English skills as well â€” it includes a lot of useful and high-level expressions that are perfect for learning and practicing English in a fun way." - Student, 16</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"Well, at first i was very confused but after the first round i got it and from then on it was very enjoyable. I really liked the game because it challenges you to use your creativity. For
people whos first language is not english its definitely a very good way to
improve their knowledge. In the future i would definitwly do an easier version which could be played by kids or younger people because it could teach them very good lessons. Overall i think this game was an amazing idea . I love the design and the application is really cool so far. I think youre a very creative person and i wish you the best in the future!!:)" - Student, 15</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"I would definitely recommend it to anyone who speaks English, even at a basic level. The game is a great way to improve your English skills while having fun. You can learn new expressions and vocabulary in a playful and entertaining way, which makes the learning process much more enjoyable.
